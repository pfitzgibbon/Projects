# Projects
upper level folder holding sub folders for the different tech/code I have worked with. 
projects might span multiple tech, as in might have initially done something with Excel then did it in Python. 
My experience is mostly in Tableau, Excel, Excel VBA, SQL, and Python. 
But I mostly try to just stick to Python since becoming more confident in it.
