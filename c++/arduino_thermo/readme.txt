my first trial at coding (this was spring 2015 i believe) was creating a thermostat with an arduino (c++ based code). 
it went well, i was the first member of my class to get mine to work then helped others
get theirs working. as it was my first time coding, i thought it was cool and exciting once i got it working
but it was pretty hard and i still had barely any experience in it so i didn't want to pursue it. most compsci
majors i met had been coding since like middle school so i just assumed i'd be way behind and could never catch up.
i majored in industrial engineering, found operations research to be really interesting once i started learning algorithms
and excel solver.

fast forward to my senior year of college (spring 2019) and i was coding again in excel vba and learning very basics of python.
went 4 years without touching coding (unless you count sql, which i really don't), but got a job where i had to learn it and 
have kept learning ever since to the point that i consider my career path now pretty much tied to coding and compsci.
