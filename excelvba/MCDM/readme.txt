The files contained in this project detail different 'multi-criteria decision making' (MCDM) techniques implemented within Excel.

The file on AHP and Smarter shows how these methods work, and provides an easy to use Excel template for performing the steps to 
calculate weights for metrics based off user/stakeholder preferences for those metrics. 

The second file runs a monte carlo simulation over a TOPSIS calculation to perform a sensitivity analysis on the resulting scores, 
sensitivy being the preferences for the metrics changing randomly. This file can be used with any size data set of metric data, any
size group of anlternatives to investigate, the VBA code within the workbook was made to be dynamic to the inputs. All this file needs 
is data and then clicking run, and the results with analysis and charts are automatically created for you.
