this is a project i did when i was considering leaving boston to live somewhere else post graduation.
i wanted to search for city data (metrics) and use a decision science method i learned, TOPSIS, to rate cities (based off those metrics)
and find the best one given my preferences for those metrics. 
I looked into general city data and also pay data for my specific major of induatrial engineering.
made these in 2018 when i didn't know python, now its 2021 and i know python so recreating these with python is a future goal of mine.
