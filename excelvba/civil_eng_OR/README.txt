this folder is for the projects that got me into ooperations research, civil engineering projects. I was in Engineers without Borders
in college and always wanted to apply my major to problems the program faced (aside from just managment as I served as Program Director
for a year during my time in it). Finally after taking a supply chain class I had learned about a whole lot of logistics algorithms, 
like k-means and minimum spanning tree. Some might not know these as logistics algorithms, but that's how they were introduced to me. Since
I've learned all the different applications many of these algorithms have and how logitics is just one area they can be useful. I wanted to 
learn more about these algorithms and how to actually make them so I started with something I knew, Excel (had not learned coding yet at 
this point). 

I created a tool for locating optimal locations of tap stands for communities using Excel Solver and VBA and the K-Means 
algorithm. Then I saw the minimum spanning tree algorithm could be applied to designing an entire water distribution system, choosing the
minimum distance between homes, where distance is defined by cost of pipe and restraints are in place to assure hydraulically it all works.
I was not able to finish the project; Excel not being capable of handling all the variables/constraints, not knowing how to get around that, 
then learning that I could get around it with VBA but then that code not working and there not being much out there for VBA help. 
I took a break from it and decided to just read research on how others have done it/improved it with different heuristics, and found that it's 
a problem that's been solved many time with many methods and what I was trying was nothing new. 

I've thought of just doing it in Python, but it's not high on my list of projects to attempt since it has no use to me anymore (I'm not part of EWB anymore) 
and there are other software already created that would do the same thing.
