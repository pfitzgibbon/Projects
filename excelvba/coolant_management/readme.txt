these files were part of a technical project i did at a manufacturing plant. though not coding, these did
use a lot of data analysis and excel formulas and shows a very different skill set than a lot of other projects i have done. 
this was the first real data backed project i ever worked on (well led).

our main goal was data based decison making for coolant management, using this system i built.
