these files were part of a technical project i did at a manufacturing plant. though not coding, these did
use a lot of data analysis and excel formulas and shows a very different skill set than a lot of other projects i have done. 
this was the first real data backed project i ever worked on (well led).

our main goal was data based decison making for coolant management, using this system i built.

the automation pdf included was when i started researching how to automate the tracking of machine run times.
i looked into this because i spent 30+ hours of that internship (at least) just timing people do their machining 
operations. i knew there must be a better way so i looked into if there was code you could include in the CNC language 
(forget what it was called, but it was whatever code goes into a cnc machine) that would record timing. I found it and
wrote it down, but never got to test implement it.
