this is a decision support system (DSS) designed to help allocate funding to the different parks of the NPS.
done as part of my capstone project for my degree at northeastern univeristy. project completed with 3 others,
i handled project management and most of the technical research and algorithm building, initial vba building (modeling the algorithm), and general GUI design.
I passed off the vba code to a different member who knew vba better (i've since learned more and developed my skills with vba) and completed the most of the rest
of the DSS building, i helped with some still and the others members helped here and there. 

the project also had a research and design report; totalled 60+ pages of content (total report 100+ pages) and 50+ sources.
the algorithm was AHP-TOPSIS hybrid method (methods from multi criteria decision making) with a Normalized Weighted Sum Multi-Objective Integer Linear Program, 
which i still stand by as a great method of rating alternatives, and either choosing between them or assigning them based off metrics. proposed the method for 
work projects later on while working as an operations research analyst at LMI. 

if you want to read the report or any other supporting doc like the executive summary, please contact me here. 
only file included here is the excel vba based dashboard.
