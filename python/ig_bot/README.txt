built this in late summer 2019

this project was me testing out my hand at python, was just starting to learn it for work and decided a project on my own time 
was needed to jumpstart my learning. I picked an instabot because i just created a page for my art and wanted to 
gain more followers but didn't want to spend all the time and effort doing it. Thought it was a good way to kill 2 birds with 
one stone. 

started with code from the link below then added more and more to make it more comprehensive. Sadly i did this when
IG was getting more and more strict, I'd get warning after warning, kept getting my comments blocked. then i added a bit of code
get past that pop up and report it and as soon as i added that i got a warning that if i kept using 3rd party software my account 
would be banned so that's when i stopped working on it. 

I learned how to web scrape and interact with web pages with selenium web driver
which is valuable to me as several projects i want to do in the future require web scraping.
