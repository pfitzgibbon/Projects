worked an internship (co-op) for 6 months working with a equipment asset management (EAM) database 
for the maintenance department at the company i worked at. a few of the SQL functions i created are
listed here. 

my goal was creating long sql functions to extensively manipulate data entirely within sql so no
further analysis within excel was needed (did not know python at the time).
